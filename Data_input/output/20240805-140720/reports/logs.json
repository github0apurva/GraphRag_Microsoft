But I'd\nbetter take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'\nAs she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door\nof which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'\nengraved upon it.  She went in without knocking, and hurried\nupstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,\nand be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and\ngloves.\n\n  `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going\nmessages for a rabbit!  I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on\nmessages next!'  And she began fancying the sort of thing that\nwould happen:  `\"Miss Alice!  Come here directly, and get ready\nfor your walk!\" \"Coming in a minute, nurse!  But I've got to see\nthat the mouse doesn't get out.\"  Only I don't think,' Alice went\non, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering\npeople about like that!'\n\n  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with\na table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two\nor three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and\na pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when\nher eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-\nglass.  There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'\nbut nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  `I know\nSOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,\n`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this\nbottle does.  I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for\nreally I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'\n\n  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:\nbefore she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing\nagainst the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being\nbroken.  She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself\n`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I\ncan't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so\nmuch!'\n\n  Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and\ngrowing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in\nanother minute there was not even room for this, and she tried\nthe effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the\nother arm curled round her head.  Still she went on growing, and,\nas a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one\nfoot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,\nwhatever happens.  What WILL become of me?'\n\n  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full\neffect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable,\nand, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting\nout of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n\n  `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one\nwasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about\nby mice and rabbits.  I almost wish I hadn't gone down that\nrabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,\nthis sort of life!  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!\nWhen I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing\nnever happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!  There\nought to be a book written about me, that there ought!  And when\nI grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a\nsorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more\nHERE.'\n\n  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I\nam now?  That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--\nbut then--always to have lessons to learn!  Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'\n\n  `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself.  `How can you\nlearn lessons in here?  Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no\nroom at all for any lesson-books!'\n\n  And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,\nand making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few\nminutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n\n  `Mary Ann!  Mary Ann!' said the voice.  `Fetch me my gloves\nthis moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on the\nstairs.  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and\nshe trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she\nwas now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no\nreason to be afraid of it.\n\n  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;\nbut, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed\nhard against it, that attempt proved a failure.

And here Alice began to get\nrather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\nway, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do\nbats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\nquestion, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she\nwas walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very\nearnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a\nbat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\nsticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n\n  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a\nmoment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her\nwas another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in\nsight, hurrying down it.

She was close behind it when she turned the\ncorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\nhanging from the roof.\n\n  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\nother, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\nwondering how she was ever to get out again.\n\n  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\nand Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\ndoors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\nthe key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\nthem.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\ncurtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\ndoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\nin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n\n  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small\npassage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\nlooked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\nHow she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about\namong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\nshe could not even get her head through the doorway; `and even if\nmy head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\nvery little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\nI could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\nknow how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\nhad happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\nthings indeed were really impossible.\n\n  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\nwent back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\nit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\ntelescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\ncertainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\nof the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'\nbeautifully printed on it in large letters.\n\n  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\nAlice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\nfirst,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not';\nfor she had read several nice little histories about children who\nhad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\nthings, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\ntheir friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\nwill burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\nnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\n`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\nlater.\n\n  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\nto taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\nof mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\nturkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\nit off.\n\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n         *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\n\n  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up\nlike a telescope.'\n\n  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and\nher face\n######################\nOutput:"}}

And\nshe kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so\nthat her idea of the tale was something like this:--\n\n                    `Fury said to a\n                   mouse, That he\n                 met in the\n               house,\n            \"Let us\n              both go to\n                law:  I will\n                  prosecute\n                    YOU.  --Come,\n                       I'll take no\n                        denial; We\n                     must have a\n                 trial:  For\n              really this\n           morning I've\n          nothing\n         to do.\"\n           Said the\n             mouse to the\n               cur, \"Such\n                 a trial,\n                   dear Sir,\n                         With\n                     no jury\n                  or judge,\n                would be\n              wasting\n             our\n              breath.\"\n               \"I'll be\n                 judge, I'll\n                   be jury,\"\n                         Said\n                    cunning\n                      old Fury:\n                     \"I'll\n                      try the\n                         whole\n                          cause,"}}

Indeed, she had\nquite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,\nand would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';\nand this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,\nand, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no\nmore to be said.\n\n  At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among\nthem, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!  I'LL\nsoon make you dry enough!'  They all sat down at once, in a large\nring, with the Mouse in the middle.

Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the\nshore.\n\n\n\n= CHAPTER III =\n=( A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale )=\n\n\n  They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the\nbank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their\nfur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and\nuncomfortable.\n\n  The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they\nhad a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed\nquite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with\nthem, as if she had known them all her life.  Indeed, she had\nquite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,\nand would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';\nand this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,\nand, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no\nmore to be said.\n\n  At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among\nthem, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!  I'LL\nsoon make you dry enough!'  They all sat down at once, in a large\nring, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice kept her eyes\nanxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad\ncold if she did not get dry very soon.\n\n  `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?\nThis is the driest thing I know.  Silence all round, if you please!\n\"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was\nsoon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been\nof late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.

The question is,\nwhat did the archbishop find?'\n\n  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,\n`\"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William\nand offer him the crown.  William's conduct at first was\nmoderate.  But the insolence of his Normans--\"  How are you\ngetting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it\nspoke.\n\n  `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn't\nseem to dry me at all.'\n\n  `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I\nmove that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more\nenergetic remedies--'\n\n  `Speak English!' said the Eaglet.  `I don't"}}

It was as much as she could do, lying down on one\nside, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get\nthrough was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to\ncry again.\n\n  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great\ngirl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in\nthis way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all\nthe same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool\nall round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the\nhall.\n\n  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the\ndistance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.\nIt was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a\npair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the\nother:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to\nhimself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she\nbe savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate\nthat she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\ncame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,\nsir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid\ngloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard\nas he could go.\n\n  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very\nhot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:\n`Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday\nthings went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in\nthe night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this\nmorning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little\ndifferent.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in\nthe world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age\nas herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of\nthem.\n\n  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such\nlong ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm\nsure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,\noh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,\nand--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all the\nthings I used to know.

However, the\nMultiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.\nLondon is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,\nand Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been\nchanged for Mabel!  I'll try and say \"How doth the little--\"'\nand she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,\nand began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and\nstrange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--\n\n            `How doth the little crocodile\n              Improve his shining tail,\n            And pour the waters of the Nile\n              On every golden scale!\n\n            `How cheerfully he seems to grin,\n              How neatly spread his claws,\n            And welcome little fishes in\n              With gently smiling jaws!'\n\n  `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and\nher eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel\nafter all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little\nhouse, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so\nmany lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm\nMabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their\nheads down and saying \"Come up again, dear!\"  I shall only look\nup and say \"Who am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I\nlike being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down\nhere till I'm somebody else\"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a\nsudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads\ndown!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'\n\n  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was\nsurprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little\nwhite kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done\nthat?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up\nand went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,\nas nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,\nand was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the\ncause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it\n######################\nOutput:"}}

However, the\nMultiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.\nLondon is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,\nand Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been\nchanged for Mabel!  I'll try and say \"How doth the little--\"'\nand she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,\nand began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and\nstrange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--\n\n            `How doth the little crocodile\n              Improve his shining tail,\n            And pour the waters of the Nile\n              On every golden scale!\n\n            `How cheerfully he seems to grin,\n              How neatly spread his claws,\n            And welcome little fishes in\n              With gently smiling jaws!'\n\n  `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and\nher eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel\nafter all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little\nhouse, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so\nmany lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm\nMabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their\nheads down and saying \"Come up again, dear!\"  I shall only look\nup and say \"Who am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I\nlike being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down\nhere till I'm somebody else\"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a\nsudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads\ndown!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'\n\n  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was\nsurprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little\nwhite kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done\nthat?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up\nand went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,\nas nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,\nand was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the\ncause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it"}}

Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought\nit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\nwondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\nbut when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\ntake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\ndown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\n  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\nconsidering how in the world she was to get out again.\n\n  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found herself\nfalling down a very deep well.\n\n  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she\nhad plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to\nwonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look\ndown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\nsee anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\nnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\nhere and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She\ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was\nlabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\nsomebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\nfell past it.\n\n  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\nshall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\nall think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\neven if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely\ntrue.)\n\n  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I\nwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.\n`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\nme see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\nyou see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her\nlessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good\nopportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to\nlisten to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,\nthat's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\nor Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\nor Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to\nsay.)\n\n  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\nTHROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the\npeople that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I\nthink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this\ntime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\nhave to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\nPlease, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\nto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\nthrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\nnever do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\n\n  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\nbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I\nshould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember\nher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were\ndown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\nyou might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\nBut do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\nrather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\nway, `\n######################\nOutput:"}}

I'll set\nDinah at you!'\n\n  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to\nherself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any\nsense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they\nbegan moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A\nbarrowful will do, to begin with.'\n\n  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to\ndoubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came\nrattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.\n`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,\n`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead\nsilence.\n\n  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all\nturning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright\nidea came into her head.  `If I eat one of these cakes,' she\nthought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it\ncan't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I\nsuppose.'\n\n  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find\nthat she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small\nenough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and\nfound quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.\nThe poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by\ntwo guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.\nThey all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she\nran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a\nthick wood.\n\n  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she\nwandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;\nand the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.\nI think that will be the best plan.'\n\n  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and\nsimply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the\nsmallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering\nabout anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over\nher head made her look up in a great hurry.\n\n  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round\neyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.\n`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried\nhard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the\ntime at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it\nwould be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\n\n  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of\nstick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped\ninto the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,\nand rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice\ndodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run\nover; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy\nmade another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in\nits hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very\nlike having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\nmoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle\nagain; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the\nstick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long\nway back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat\ndown a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its\nmouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n\n  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;\nso she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out\nof breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the\ndistance.\n\n  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she\nleant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself\nwith one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks\nvery much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!

Alice looked all round\nher at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see\nanything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under\nthe circumstances.

It was opened by another footman in livery,\nwith a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,\nAlice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their\nheads.  She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and\ncrept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n\n  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great\nletter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to\nthe other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess.  An\ninvitation from the Queen to play croquet.'  The Frog-Footman\nrepeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the\nwords a little, `From the Queen.  An invitation for the Duchess\nto play croquet.'\n\n  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled\ntogether.\n\n  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into\nthe wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped\nout the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the\nground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n\n  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n\n  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and\nthat for two reasons.  First, because I'm on the same side of the\ndoor as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise\ninside, no one could possibly hear you.'  And certainly there was\na most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling\nand sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish\nor kettle had been broken to pieces.\n\n  `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'\n\n  `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went\non without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For\ninstance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let\nyou out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time\nhe was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  `But\nperhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so\nVERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might\nanswer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.\n\n  `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'\n\n  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate\ncame skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just\ngrazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees\nbehind him.\n\n  `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,\nexactly as if nothing had happened.\n\n  `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n\n  `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman.  `That's the\nfirst question, you know.'\n\n  It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.\n`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the\ncreatures argue.  It's enough to drive one crazy!'\n\n  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for\nrepeating his remark, with variations.  `I shall sit here,' he\nsaid, `on and off, for days and days.'\n\n  `But what am I to do?' said Alice.\n\n  `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.\n\n  `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:\n`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.\n\n  The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of\nsmoke from one end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a\nthree-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was\nleaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to\nbe full of soup.\n\n  `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to\nherself, as well as she could for sneezing.\n\n  There was certainly too much of it in the air.  Even the\nDuchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was\nsneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.  The\nonly things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,\nand a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from\near to ear.\n\n  `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for\nshe was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to\nspeak first, `why your cat grins like that?'\n\n  `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why\n######################\nOutput:"}}
